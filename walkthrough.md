# Walkthrough.
-------------

The character starts the game in office room.
There is an empty seat.

If player tries to make the character to seat in the empty seat,
character says "That's not the seat I booked for. Alice is in the my seat."

If player talks to other NPCs than Alice, they will answer small talk about the day, the weather, whatever.
If player takls to Alice, she says she would gladly change the seat, but seat A has no mouse.

# Quest for the mouse
If player goes to the terrace , will find the mouse.
But there is a pidgeon between the player and the mouse and player fears pidgeons.
He must return to the office, interact with the plant and he will take a branch.

Back to the terrace, use the branch to make the pidgeon leave. Take the mouse.
Back to the office, give mouse to Alice.

Now Alice says the problem is she must be next to Bob because they work together.
So, for Alice goint got seat A, Bob must be in his seat,which is seat B.

# Making Bob's seat available.
The problem is that Eve is on seat B.
If player talks to Eve, Eve will agree, but she needs to be next to David to work.
So player now must ask David to go to seat D. But Charlie is on seat D.

# Making David's seat available
We go to Charlie to ask for changing seats with David and occupy seat C, but he feels super tired
because the coffe machine doesn't work and he needs coffee.

# Getting some coffee
Then go to the kitchen. Interacting with coffe machine shows that it doesn't work.
Open the drawer in office, find the coffee machine's manual.
When taking manual, player learns that coffe machine needs to be plugged in because it needs electricity to work.
Back to the machine, interact 1 time "OK, plugged in." Interact ahother time "BZZZZZ" and a cup of coffee will appear on the inventory.
Give coffee to charlie.

# End of the game
A dialog appears "SOME SEAT SWITCHING AFTER..."

And then everybody is on the correct seat, end of the game.
